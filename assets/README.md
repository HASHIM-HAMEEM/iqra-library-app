# IQRA Splash Asset

Place `iqra_splash.png` in this folder.

Requirements:
- Transparent PNG, square, exported around 1024Ã—1024.
- No extra outer padding; keep mark centered.
- This is not the adaptive app icon; it's the splash mark used by flutter_native_splash.

After adding the file, run:

```
dart run flutter_native_splash:create --path=../splash.yaml
```
